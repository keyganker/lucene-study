/** IndexReader is an abstract class, providing an interface for accessing an
  index.  Search of an index is done entirely through this abstract interface,
  so that any subclass which implements it is searchable.

  <p> Concrete subclasses of IndexReader are usually constructed with a call to
  the static method {@link #open}.

  <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
  <it>document numbers</it>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
  document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral--they may change
  as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
  rely on a given document having the same number between sessions. */
